Water Polution Analysis of Ganga - Class 7 Project

The data was taken from [data.gov](https://www.data.gov.in/catalog/water-quality-data-river-ganga). 

The data refers to Water Quality Data for stations across the river Ganga as a comparative study between 1986 and 2011 with parameters such as Dissolved Oxygen (DO) and Biological Oxygen Demand (BOD).
